MyPage - Watch Later Movie List Web Application

The MyPage web application allows users to create and manage their Watch Later list for movies. It provides a user-friendly interface for adding movies to the Watch Later list and viewing the list of movies they've added. The application is built using React for the frontend and Node.js with MySQL for the backend.

Features

Homepage with Carousel: The homepage displays a carousel of "Throwback Thursday Movies" using the AliceCarousel library. The carousel automatically plays videos and provides an engaging display.
Navigation Bar: The application includes a navigation bar at the top of the page, allowing users to navigate between different pages, such as Home, Search, Review, and MyPage.
Add to Watch Later: On the "MyPage," users can select a movie from the dropdown list of available movies and click the "Add to Watch Later" button. The selected movie is then added to the user's Watch Later list.
Watch Later List: The "MyPage" displays the user's Watch Later list. If the user has added movies to the list, they will be shown as a list of movie names. If the Watch Later list is empty, a message will indicate that there are no movies in the list.
